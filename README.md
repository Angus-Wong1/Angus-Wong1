## 🧠 About Me

**Data Engineer | Cloud Architect | Automation & Systems Specialist**

I build **high-performance data infrastructure** that turns raw telemetry into live, operational insight.  
My background combines **data engineering, distributed systems, and DevOps automation**, letting me design pipelines that scale linearly, recover automatically, and drive measurable ROI.

- **Current role:** Data Engineer @ *Alabama Power Company*  
- **Core expertise:** large-scale ETL, predictive maintenance, telemetry ingestion, and low-latency cloud analytics  
- **Philosophy:** engineer systems that are **auditable, performant, and maintainable** — without unnecessary complexity

## 📈 Career Direction

I’m focused on **high-impact, high-compensation technical roles** such as:

- **Senior / Staff Data Engineer** — Databricks · Snowflake · Stripe · Airbnb  
- **ML Infra / MLOps Engineer** — OpenAI · Anthropic · Palantir · DeepMind  
- **Cloud Data Architect / Platform Engineer** — AWS · GCP · Cloudflare · Microsoft  

I aim to design systems that are:
- **Observable** – rich logging, metrics, and tracing baked in  
- **Reproducible** – deterministic pipelines via CI/CD and IaC  
- **Cost-efficient** – compute and storage balanced against business value  

My long-term focus is on **AI-aligned infrastructure**, bridging classical data engineering with machine learning operations.

## 🧾 Future Roadmap

- 🧩 **Learning:** dbt · MLflow · Airflow · AWS Glue · Terraform  
- ⚙️ **Certifications:** Databricks Data Engineer Pro | AWS Data Analytics Specialty | GCP Data Engineer  
- 🧠 **Projects to publish:**  
  - Real-time Kafka + Spark Streaming demo  
  - Data warehouse model using dbt + Snowflake  
  - MLOps pipeline (MLflow + FastAPI + Docker)
